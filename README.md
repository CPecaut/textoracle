# textoracle

This is the prototype of a learning platform that will change the nature of reading texts.

It selects random sentences, with a blank, which you then guess.

Then you are given the answer and a chance to create a question about the content.

Then you are asked your own question when provided with the context therein contained.

The answers are then all recorded.
